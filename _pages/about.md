My name is 聂良玉(Liangyu Nie), I'm currently a Master of advanced computer science student at University of Birmingham(UK), before Birmingham, I spend 3 wonderful years at RMIT University(Melbourne Australia) for my bachelor. I worked with [Prof.Wenpeng Yin](https://www.wenpengyin.org/) on Instruction Learning and [Prof.Huajie Shao](https://shj1987.github.io/) on Memory based Continual Learning.

I am interested in natural language processing. More specifically (yet still vague), I am interested in the following questions:

1. How language models learn knowledge efficiently？
2. How do we build efficient (data- and computing-) models that can answer "complex and compositional" questions, and questions with non-definite answer formats in the real world?
