Hello, my name is 聂良玉 (Niè liáng yù), and I am currently a first-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Dallas. Prior to this, I pursued a Master's in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Birmingham in the UK. My academic journey began at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, where I spent three enriching years completing my bachelor's degree. Throughout my academic endeavors, I've had the privilege of working with two distinguished professors. Under the mentorship of Prof. Wenpeng Yin(https://www.wenpengyin.org/), I delved deep into the realm of Instruction Learning. I also collaborated with Prof. Huajie Shao(https://shj1987.github.io/) on pioneering research in Memory-based Continual Learning. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to [chat](mailto:Liangyu.Nie@UTDallas.edu) :)

I am interested in natural language processing. More specifically NLP for Science(Material Discovery, Drug Discovery, Psychology etc.)
