My name is 聂良玉(Niè liáng yù), I'm a incoming PhD student of UT Dallas,work with [Prof.Xinya Du](https://xinyadu.github.io/index.html). And currently a Master of advanced computer science student at University of Birmingham(UK), before Birmingham, I spend 3 wonderful years at RMIT University(Melbourne Australia) for my bachelor. I worked with [Prof.Wenpeng Yin](https://www.wenpengyin.org/) on Instruction Learning and [Prof.Huajie Shao](https://shj1987.github.io/) on Memory based Continual Learning.


Feel free to reach out if you'd like to [chat](mailto:Liangyu.Nie@UTDallas.edu) :)

I am interested in natural language processing. More specifically (yet still vague), I am interested in the following questions:

1. How do we build efficient (data- and computing-) models that can answer "complex and compositional" questions, and questions with non-definite answer formats in the real world? 
2. How Language Models Personalize？
3. How language models can be more sincere(no lies no deceit)？
